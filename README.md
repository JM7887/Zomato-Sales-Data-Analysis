# Zomato-Sales-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Zomato sales data to uncover key insights into restaurant performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful business insights.


## Objective

- Understand sales patterns and trends in Zomato's dataset.
- Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
- Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
- What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?


## Dataset Description

- The dataset contains details about orders, customers, ratings, and restaurant information.
- Key columns include Restaurant Name, Online booking, Rating, Votes, listed in and approx_cost.
- The data is cleaned and processed to remove missing or inconsistent values.


## Technologies Used

- Python (for data analysis)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)


## Methodology

- Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding patterns using visualizations.
- Customer Behavior Analysis – Identifying preferences based on ratings 
- Conclusion & Recommendations – Summarizing key insights for business decisions.

## Conclusion 

Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
